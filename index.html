            <h1><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The rate of pregnancy in our society today is growing rapidly, so are miscarriages and stillbirth with the vax majority of those cases are due to ignorance and mis-information.
                Hence the need for complete and accurate knowledge of this topic can never be over emphasized.
                Antinantal care is a very vital part of pregnancy as it help to prepare the mother for what is to come on every stage of the pregnancy. hence every stage is very vital.

                Pregnancy is the time during which one or more offspring develops (gestates) inside a woman's uterus (womb).
                 A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins.[14] Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.
                   A pregnancy may end in a live birth, a miscarriage, an induced abortion, or a stillbirth. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP), a span known as the gestational age. 
                    This is just over nine months. Counting by fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. 
                    Pregnancy is "the presence of an implanted human embryo or fetus in the uterus"; implantation occurs on average 8–9 days after fertilization.
                     An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first seven weeks following implantation (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth.

                <h1>FIRST TRIMESTER (Weeks 0-12)</h1>
                <p>Your baby is conceived when a sperm cell penetrates the egg. This happens around the end of week 2 of your pregnancy. It is at this moment that your baby’s sex is determined. This depends on whether the sperm cell was carrying an X chromosome (a baby girl) or a Y chromosome (a baby boy). 
                For some women, the first trimester is characterised by nausea (often called ‘morning sickness’, although it can occur at any time of day). But remember that every pregnancy is different and while some women have food cravings, others experience food aversions, and some have no change in appetite at all. 
                Other changes in the first trimester include changes to your breasts as they become tender, larger and heavier, while your uterus will grow and put pressure on your bladder so that you need to urinate more often. </p>
            
                
                    <h2>YOUR EMOTIONS</h2>
            <p>You might feel a range of emotions during your first trimester. Hormone changes may make you feel moody or irritable, and tiredness is common in the early months. 
            These feelings are normal, so discuss how you feel with you partner or with a close friend. If you feel down or anxious, speak with your doctor or midwife.</p>
             
            
             <h2>What happens to the baby?</h2>
            <p>Through the first trimester, your baby goes from being a fertilised ovum to a fetus of about 6cm in length at 12 weeks. 
            By the end of the first trimester, your baby’s heart is starting to beat, and the brain, stomach and intestines are developing. 
            There are little bumps known as 'buds' where arms and legs are starting to grow.</p>
