            <h1><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The rate of pregnancy in our society today is growing rapidly, so are miscarriages and stillbirth with the vax majority of those cases are due to ignorance and mis-information.
                Hence the need for complete and accurate knowledge of this topic can never be over emphasized.
                Antinantal care is a very vital part of pregnancy as it help to prepare the mother for what is to come on every stage of the pregnancy. hence every stage is very vital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pregnancy is the time during which one or more offspring develops (gestates) inside a woman's uterus (womb).
                 A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins.[14] Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.
                   A pregnancy may end in a live birth, a miscarriage, an induced abortion, or a stillbirth. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP), a span known as the gestational age. 
                    This is just over nine months. Counting by fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. 
                    Pregnancy is "the presence of an implanted human embryo or fetus in the uterus"; implantation occurs on average 8–9 days after fertilization.
                     An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first seven weeks following implantation (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth.

                <h1>FIRST TRIMESTER (Weeks 0-12)</h1>
                <p>Your baby is conceived when a sperm cell penetrates the egg. This happens around the end of week 2 of your pregnancy. It is at this moment that your baby’s sex is determined. This depends on whether the sperm cell was carrying an X chromosome (a baby girl) or a Y chromosome (a baby boy). 
                For some women, the first trimester is characterised by nausea (often called ‘morning sickness’, although it can occur at any time of day). But remember that every pregnancy is different and while some women have food cravings, others experience food aversions, and some have no change in appetite at all. 
                Other changes in the first trimester include changes to your breasts as they become tender, larger and heavier, while your uterus will grow and put pressure on your bladder so that you need to urinate more often. </p>
            
                
                    <h2>YOUR EMOTIONS</h2>
            <p>You might feel a range of emotions during your first trimester. Hormone changes may make you feel moody or irritable, and tiredness is common in the early months. 
            These feelings are normal, so discuss how you feel with you partner or with a close friend. If you feel down or anxious, speak with your doctor or midwife.</p>
             
            
             <h2>What happens to the baby?</h2>
            <p>Through the first trimester, your baby goes from being a fertilised ovum to a fetus of about 6cm in length at 12 weeks. 
            By the end of the first trimester, your baby’s heart is starting to beat, and the brain, stomach and intestines are developing. 
            There are little bumps known as 'buds' where arms and legs are starting to grow.</p>

            <h3>What can be expected from the Doctors and midwives</h3>
            <p>Your antenatal (pregnancy) health checks might be with your GP, a midwife or an obstetrician, depending on where you will give birth.
             During your first antenatal health check, you will probably have your pregnancy confirmed with a urine or blood test. These are more
              reliable than home pregnancy tests. First trimester antenatal health checks usually happen every 4 to 6 weeks, but this can vary, 
              based on your health and how your baby develops.</p>
            <p>Many women are offered an ultrasound scan at around 12 weeks – you might hear the baby’s heartbeat at this scan. This ultrasound will
            also show if you are having a multiple birth (e.g. twins) and can help estimate the baby’s size and due date, as well as check for some 
            health conditions.</p>
            
                
                    <h3>Other health checks during the first trimester include:</h3> 
                    
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Urine tests:</em></strong> to detect urinary infections, a common but manageable condition that if left untreated can trigger pre-term labour</li>
            
            <li><strong><em>Blood tests:</em></strong> to check your blood type (particularly Rh status), iron levels, blood sugars (for gestational diabetes), rubella 
            (German measles) immunity, and other infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis</li>
            <li><strong><em>General maternal health and wellbeing checks</em></strong> including a discussion of concerns you might have about your pregnancy or general health, and a medication review (including natural or alternative medicines) to check for safety during pregnancy </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The second trimester of pregnancy is a time when many women will feel energised and well. You will become visibly pregnant, but you won’t be so heavy that getting around is difficult. This is also a time of rapid growth and development for your baby, and you may find yourself busy with health checks and planning for the birth.</p>

    <h1>What is the second trimester?</h1>
    <p>Trimesters are a helpful way to think about pregnancy because the changes that happen to you and your baby fall into 3 broad categories of early, middle and late pregnancy, as reflected in the first, second and third trimesters.
    The second trimester represents the middle part of your pregnancy, from weeks 13 to 26. For many women, one of the best things about this trimester is that nausea might begin to settle.
    In the second trimester, your baby’s hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes, begins to grow. Muscles and bones continue to develop, allowing more movement. If your baby is a girl, her eggs will develop in her ovaries early in the second trimester. By about week 18, your baby can hear your heartbeat and may even be startled by loud noises.
    Your baby will grow quickly in the second trimester. You will be able to feel this. It will put pressure on your lungs, stomach, bladder, and kidneys. You may begin to feel your baby move during the fifth month. By the end of the second trimester, you will be able to feel that your baby has resting and alert periods. As a result of the development of taste buds and sensory neurons, your baby will be able to taste and touch during the second trimester.
    By the end of week 23, your baby probably weighs about a pound. Babies born this early may be able to survive with the help of expert medical care, but they usually have mental and physical disabilities.
    Your baby’s eyes are sealed shut until the end of the second trimester when your baby starts to blink. By the end of the second trimester, your baby will weigh almost 2 pounds and will be about 1 foot long. By now, all of the essential organs have formed.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens to your body?</h2>
    <p>Your body will undergo some major changes during the second trimester. Your uterus will grow, and you may feel some discomfort or aches as uterine ligaments stretch. You will start to feel your skin stretch around your belly and your breasts, which may cause mild itching. Some women get stretch marks in these areas, which tend to fade over time.
        Although your baby weighs less than a kilo, your blood volume will increase to meet the demands of all the growth happening inside you, which will mean you will gain some additional weight.</p>
    
    <h2>Your emotions</h2>
    <p>Pregnancy can be a wonderful and exciting time, but it’s also important to expect to feel some occasional days of heightened anxiety or low mood.
    Sometimes one or both parents experience difficult emotions during pregnancy, such as being worried about the birth or about coping as a parent.
    Feelings of anxiety are not uncommon, and some women will experience symptoms of a condition called anxiety disorder. Antenatal depression is a mood disorder that includes intense emotional changes beyond those you might expect during pregnancy.
    If you are worried about feelings of anxiety, low mood or depression, you could: see your doctor, obstetrician, child health nurse or midwife</p>

    <h2>What happens to the baby?</h2>
    <p>During the second trimester, your baby will grow from being around 7.5cm, and weighing 30 grams in week 13, to around 23cm and 820 grams at week 26.
    
    Your baby will be able to move freely within the amniotic sac in your uterus. By about week 19 (or sooner if this isn’t your first pregnancy), you may feel this movement – as a faint tickling or fluttering. During these 3 months, your baby’s organs will continue to develop and the liver, pancreas and kidneys all start to function. This is also the time when babies might start to suck their thumb. By week 20 your baby can hear sounds, including the sound of your heartbeat, and they are learning to recognise your voice, although the ears are not yet fully formed.
    What can you expect at your antenatal visits?
    Regular antenatal visits are an important part of staying healthy and making sure your baby is healthy. How often you see your health professional will depend on your personal circumstances, but for many women, visits will be every 4 to 6 weeks.
    
    At all visits during your second trimester, you will have your blood pressure checked, and your hands and feet will also be checked for swelling. You might be weighed, have blood taken for tests and have your urine checked.
    
    Your doctor or midwife will check your abdomen to monitor your baby’s growth and will listen to your baby’s heartbeat. If you didn’t have an ultrasound in your first trimester, you may be offered one at around 18 to 20 weeks.</p>
    <h3>How to stay healthy</h3>
    <p>Eating well and staying active is as important as ever during pregnancy - it's good for your physical and emotional health, and good for your baby too. Light-to-moderate exercise in pregnancy is usually safe: consider walking, swimming, yoga and stationary cycling in your second trimester. High-impact exercise and activities where there is a risk of falling, getting hurt (especially around the stomach) or overheating are not recommended.
    
    Your choice of food during your pregnancy is also important – but that doesn’t mean ‘eating for two’. What you eat during your pregnancy has been shown to affect how your baby grows as well as your baby’s health later in life.</p>
    <h2><strong>Things to consider in the second trimester</strong></h2>
    Parental leave – discuss with your partner and then with your employer:
    <ul>
        <li>How will you share the care of your baby with your partner (or other family members)?</li>
        <li>When do you plan to start your leave?</li>
        <li>When you intend to return to work?</li>
        <li>When is a good time to share your pregnancy news with your employer?</li>
        <li>Will your role at work change after your baby is born?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><strong>Antenatal classes:</strong></h3>
    
    Ask your midwife or doctor about antenatal education available in your area.
    Consider going to classes together with your birthing partner – not only will you learn a lot about how to prepare for labour, you’ll meet people who will share their experience of becoming parents.
