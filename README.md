Welcome to My readme page.
Hi. 
my name is bright Anyiador and i am a student at Code institute, i am also a full time worker at Lloyds banking group. 
this project is about the beautiful part of recreation and process of pregnancy. this project was inspired by my wife.
during my time with code institute we have just found out that we are pregnant and got very excited and ofcourse its not enough just to wait for information from the Doctors so i went online to get some information and to read about this entire stage and how best to help my wife during this period.  though we lost our baby on 14th December 2022 due to miscarriage but i was kin to making sure this project is completed and enlightenment about the importance and value of pregnancy education .
during this project which took 3 days to build i have encountered alot of changes and had to go back to the training manual of code institute to get answers . i have also learned alot of code from the site: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_frameworks.asp#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=video. among many others. 
the text and words on this site where major contents and teachings from https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=101070#:~:text=Your%20first%20trimester%20lasts%20until,between%20weeks%2038%20and%2042. and pregnancybirthbaby websites. though some of the words have been modified and adjusted i still have no copy right to this content , just for educational purpose only.
a special appreciation to Mr. Tomasz Ostroga and Mrs. Lucimeri Andretta both students of Code institute for their help and support during this project. 
after the first initial project built i which had 6 pages and links,with commits i got from my mentor, i had to start all over again. with just a short time to go i had to submit this project this way. had changes making the page responsive . went over the web to get answers and was able to get through that. 
positioning items was also very hard for me as some times where easily moved but others gave more complex issues.
forgive my manners as i am not used to saying or using the word "problem"
in general i want to thank every code institute staff and mentors for all their support and help.
Happy New Year to Everyone
