Welcome to My readme page.
Hi. 
my name is bright Anyiador and i am a student at Code institute, i am also a full time worker at Lloyds banking group. 

during this project which took 3 days to build i have encountered alot of changes and had to go back to the training manual of code institute to get answers . i have also learned alot of code from the site: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_frameworks.asp#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=video. among many others. 
the text and words on this site where major contents and teachings from https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=101070#:~:text=Your%20first%20trimester%20lasts%20until,between%20weeks%2038%20and%2042. and pregnancybirthbaby websites. though some of the words have been modified and adjusted i still have no copy right to this content , just for educational purpose only.
a special appreciation to Mr. Tomasz Ostroga and Mrs. Lucimeri Andretta both students of Code institute for their help and support during this project. 
after the first initial project built i which had 6 pages and links,with commits i got from my mentor, i had to start all over again. with just a short time to go i had to submit this project this way. had changes making the page responsive . went over the web to get answers and was able to get through that. 
positioning items was also very hard for me as some times where easily moved but others gave more complex issues.
forgive my manners as i am not used to saying or using the word "problem"
in general i want to thank every code institute staff and mentors for all their support and help.
Happy New Year to Everyone

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:

Writing Your Best Code
HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices
Google HTML/CSS Style Guide
Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
